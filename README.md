Q-Fleet: A Quantum-Hybrid VRP Optimization Engine
Q-Fleet is a full-stack application developed for the Amaravati Quantum Valley Hackathon 2025. It provides a "quantum-ready" framework for solving the complex Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a hybrid quantum-classical approach. The project features a Python backend powered by Qiskit's QAOA algorithm and a modern, interactive frontend built with a JavaScript framework and deployed on Vercel.

üìã Features
Interactive UI: A clean, web-based dashboard to define VRP instances (number of vehicles, delivery locations).

Quantum Backend: Leverages the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to find optimal routes.

Problem Mapping: Automatically converts the real-world VRP into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem suitable for quantum solvers.

Tunable Algorithm: Allows users to adjust the QAOA reps (quality) parameter to see the trade-off between runtime and solution accuracy.

Interactive Visualization: Displays the final, optimized routes for each vehicle on an interactive Folium map.

API-based Architecture: Decoupled frontend and backend for a professional, scalable solution.

üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture
This project uses a modern client-server architecture. The frontend is a static web app hosted on Vercel, and the backend is a Python API hosted as a web service on Render.

Frontend (Vercel): The user interacts with the web app, defines a VRP, and clicks "Optimize".

API Request: The frontend sends a POST request with the problem data to the backend API.

Backend (Render):

The FastAPI server receives the request.

It generates a distance matrix and formulates a QUBO.

The Qiskit Sampler and QAOA algorithm find the optimal solution.

API Response: The backend returns the optimized routes and coordinates to the frontend as a JSON object.

Visualization: The frontend uses the received data to draw the routes on the interactive map.
